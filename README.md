# Meal Planner

This is my first University project.

It is a simple meal-planning console application written in Python.

## Features:

- Save recipes
  - Add tags to find them easily
  - Sort by tags, keywords, and/or preparation time
- Save repeated ingredients
- Create meal plans
  - Calculate total preparation time
  - Generate shopping list
  - Specify days of the week
