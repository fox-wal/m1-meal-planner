# Meal Planner

This is my first University project.

It is a simple meal-planning console application written in Python.

## Features:

- Save recipes
  - Add tags to find them easily
  - Sort by tags, keywords, and/or preparation time
- Save repeated ingredients
- Create meal plans
  - Calculate total preparation time
  - Generate shopping list
  - Specify days of the week

## My commits

I use commit tags and conventions based on those stipulated in [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

I also write my commits in imperative, second-person present tense.

|Tag|Meaning|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`feat`|Feature: new functionality introduced|`feat: add main menu`|
|`refactor`|Improving code quality, changing things around|`refactor: move names and addresses to new class`<br>`refactor: rename 'my_file.py' to 'your_file.py'`|
|`files`|A change to a non-source file|`files: add address file`<br>`files: correct faulty addresses`|
|`chore`|A compiler/git -related commit|`chore: merge branch 'main' into 'my-feature'`<br>`chore: create .gitignore file`|
|`docs`|Documentation|`docs: write docstrings for 'main.py'`|
